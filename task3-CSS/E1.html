        <h1>Page-Level & inline CSS Styling</h1>
        <p style="color: orange;width: 1000px"> Lorem Ipsum is a type of placeholder text that has been <br/>
           used in the printing and typesetting industry since the 1500s.<br/>
           It is derived from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of “de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum,”<br/>
           a work by the Roman statesman and philosopher Cicero. <br/>
            The text has been altered and scrambled to create a nonsensical yet readable format, making it ideal for use in various design contexts.<br/>
           The primary purpose of Lorem Ipsum is to provide a sample of how text will appear in a layout, allowing designers to focus on visual elements rather than getting distracted by the content itself.<br/>
            By using placeholder text, designers can effectively visualize the flow of content, ensuring that their designs remain clean and coherent.<br/>

            <b style="font-size: 18px;">Inline Css</b> styles look and operate much like CSS, with a few differences.<br/> 
           Inline styles directly affect the tag they are written in, without the use of selectors. </p>

        <p style="background-image: url('../images/b.webp');width: 1000px; height: 100px; " >Because inline styles only affect the tag they are written in, it can be hard to make changes.
            If you have written the same style 20 times in 20 different div tags, you must edit each of those places whenever you want to make a trivial change. 
                This can be exhausting! By using a single CSS rule in a style tag or a separate CSS file, you would only need to change it in one place.
            You gain the most flexibility and power by putting your CSS in a separate CSS file. If you link to that CSS file on more than one HTML page, you can reuse the same stylesheet for multiple pages. 
            If you want a consistent style across your whole website, this is the way to go. When you want to make a change, you will only need to make the change in one file, and it will be seen in each linked page.
