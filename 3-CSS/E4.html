                The float property is used for positioning and formatting content e.g. let an image float left to the text in a container.

                The float property can have one of the following values:
                
                left - The element floats to the left of its container
                right - The element floats to the right of its container
                none - The element does not float (will be displayed just where it occurs in the text). This is default
                inherit - The element inherits the float value of its parent
                In its simplest use, the float property can be used to wrap text around images.</p>
