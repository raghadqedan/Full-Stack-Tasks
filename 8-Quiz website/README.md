## ✨ Features

- 🎨 Clean and responsive UI design
- ❓ Multiple-choice questions
- ✅ Instant feedback (correct/incorrect answer highlighting)
- ⏳ Timer for each quiz to increase challenge
- 📊 Score tracking
- If the user leaves the quiz due to issues like a power cut or page reload, their progress — current question, answers, and remaining time — is saved in localStorage.
  When they return, the quiz automatically resumes from where they left off, as long as the time hasn’t expired.
